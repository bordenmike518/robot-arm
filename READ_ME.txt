So the first thing I wanted to do when I learned to program was build a robot. It started off as a simple idea and quickly turned into a mathematic nightmare, especially since I now have it at 6DOF instead of the original 3DOF I had first created. I currently have someone learning inverse kitematics so I may have simple movements programmed in. Then I plan to add logic. ROS is quite tricky when you first get started, and there really aren't many forums dedicated to explaining how to REALLY get up and running. All of these files are required. 'Mover_2.ino' & 'poses.h' is a simple connection to get things going. 
Download and setup of ROS is required.
